# Rockbuster SQL Analysis
A data analysis project using PostgreSQL to analyze data from a fictional movie rental company, Rockbuster Stealth.
## Objectives
 The Rockbuster Stealth Management Board has asked a series of business questions and
they expect data-driven answers that they can use for their company strategy. Here are
the main questions theyâ€™d like to answer:
-  Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
-  What was the average rental duration for all videos?
-  Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
-  Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
-  Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?
## Data 
A relational database made up of 15 tables containing data on Actor, Address, Category, City, Country, Customer, Fim, Film Actor, Film Category, Inventory, Language, Staff, Store, Payment and Rental.
